 spn_embrace.0001.desc:0 "One day as you're strolling through the market, you happen upon a strange vendor that you've not seen before. It's an old woman peddling wares. There are ornaments, trinkets, the ear of some strange animal. A menagerie to be sure.\n\nAs you start to head off after taking stock of her odd assortment of wares, the peddler stops you.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have something special over here. An elixir that promises eternity but.. not without cost."\n\nThe peddler leans in close and speaks low.\n\n"The true cost is different for each person my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. My fee is 25 gold, of course.""

It feels as though all the bones in your body are breaking as your limbs begin to change shape.\n\nThe next thing you remember is waking up in an isolated area away from the castle. Blood is all over your naked body."

You can hear the maids beating heart and the wooshing of blood as it flows.\n\nThe next thing you know, she is laying there lifeless with her neck gouged open and covered in blood. You look over to a small mirror in her chambers. You find your face, neck, and torso covered in blood!"

The assailant managed to give you a fair account for themselves. In the chaos of the contest, [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe] tore into your flesh with [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] teeth. This admittedly took you by surprise, but it wasn't enough to prevent your victory.\n\nAs the court physician bandaged your wounds, your head began to throb, and you became feverish.

[spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe] agreed to spare your life on the condition that [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe] grants you the gift of immortal life. With you being like [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim], telling anyone about [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim] would put you at risk as well. Begrudgingly, you agree to the price. Though, you don't understand how much exactly you've just paid.\n\nAfter this discourse had concluded, [spn_new_created_vampire.GetTitledFirstName] took hold of you and bit your neck. The next thing you knew, [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe] was gone and your head began to throb, and you became feverish.

Coming out on the other side, you quickly found some guards to send down the passage after the intruder. The guards scoured the keep but did not find a trace of the assailant.

Sometime later, you're found by your guards and brought to the court physician.\n\nAs the court physician bandaged your neck, your head began to throb, and you became feverish.

An elegantly dressed [spn_new_created_vampire.GetWomanMan] with an unrivaled physique. I found myself fighting my primal urges and tried to behave as my status demanded. [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe|U] bows and declares [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe] has important matters to discuss but only in private. [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe|U] assures me I would be very interested."

For a small price of course”. [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe|U] speaks of beings with immense power that broke free from the shackles of time. I stand there, in shock, unable to fully comprehend [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] revelations. [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] unnatural presence and otherworldly allure give weight to [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] words but can I really trust [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim]?"

I am to choose between drinking [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] blood or allowing [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim] to bite me. With the little amount of sense left in me I choose the former.\n\nOne moment I am placing the empty goblet of blood down and the next I am standing on the bloody remains of my chambermaid.

By some miracle, your fellow hunters find you and fire arrows at the beast, it manages to kill some of them and you get injured in the melee and lose consciousness.\n\nYou awake in your bed in bandages. You feel no pain and seem to have fully healed. Your chancellor enters and explains you were attacked by a large wolf and that your retinue saved you. No one had noticed it walked the way humans do and due to a strong headache, you decided to ruminate on the matter once you feel better.\n\nThe night brings no relief. Due to a level of pain you thought wasn’t possible to experience, you can’t seem to sleep. Your entire body feels as if it is being torn apart from the inside. You scream and start destroying everything in your chambers. Your mind blacks out. In the next moment, you are standing on a hill near your castle howling to the moon.

 spn_embrace.2012.desc.a:0 "After what feels like hours, but must have been mere minutes in truth, only one guard and I remain on our feet. Bloodied and deeply wounded, our chances seem quite slim. I remember this particular guard, [spn_new_created_lycan.GetSheHe] never spoke much. Wasn’t aware [spn_new_created_lycan.GetSheHe] was such a capable fighter. I should have paid more attention. I should have done many things differently now that I think of it.\n\nI am brought back to reality by my companion’s frightening warcry. The ambushers hesitate and we take this moment to charge."

I can rest in peace knowing I gave my life to a worthy liege such as you.” [spn_new_created_lycan.GetSheHe] grabs my leg and bites into it. I can no longer withstand the pain and feint.\n\nThe pain wakes me and the full moon seems awfully close. My bones break and shift and I am overcome by a strong hunger. Without much thought, I start devouring the corpses of our ambushers. What have I become?"

Through the dim candlelight, you make out your guardsman lying on the ground. There is blood and gore strewn throughout the hallway.\n\nYou hear the sound of your guards frantically shouting throughout the keep. At the next moment, you hear a growl that sends shivers down your spine. Suddenly the glow of two large eyes reflects the light of your candle.

The beast stops at the foot of your bed briefly and then lunges under it. It's fangs and claws reaching for you.\n\nYour shrill screams bring half a dozen guardsmen to your room. With fierce battle cries, they attack. Shrieking in pain, the creature retreats from under the bed and crashes through a window in your chambers.

Not waiting to see if it holds, you bolt out into the courtyard. A crash behind you tells you that the door didn't hold.\n\nAs the beast is nearly upon you, a hooded warrior rushes to confront the beast. With the warrior and creature in battle, you take a moment to gather your wits and catch your breath. You see a spear lying on the ground, pick it up, and throw it at the creature. The distraction was enough for the stranger to behead the beast in one swift motion.\n\n"What was that?" You ask the stranger.\nAs they pull their hood back, "A Lycan... these beasts, and other foul creatures of this world, are growing in number. I'm [spn_new_created_slayer.GetTitledFirstName]." \n\n"What can be done?" You ask.\n"I can teach you to fight the beasts, but the path won't be easy.
