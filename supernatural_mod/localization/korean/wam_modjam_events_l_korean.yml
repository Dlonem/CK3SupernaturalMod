 wam_modjam_events.0001.desc:0 "My friend has asked for a word in private. They claim to have noticed my ways of controlling the fruits of the land, and desire to learn and partake in your activities."
 wam_modjam_events.0001.a:0 "You would never compare to my skills."
 wam_modjam_events.0001.a_tt:0 "They will not like this..."
 wam_modjam_events.0001.b:0 "I will teach, but you must listen."
 wam_modjam_events.0001.b_tt:0 "Knowledge is power."

 wam_modjam_events.0002.desc:0 "Your student keeps failing at some intermediate level tasks. He seems crestfallen. Some of his work has even caused dangerous accidents..."
 wam_modjam_events.0002.a:0 "You are not a failure. You can do it. Dedicate yourself. Do or do not, there are no tries anymore."
 wam_modjam_events.0002.a_tt:0 "This will surely bolster his efforts."
 wam_modjam_events.0002.b:0 "Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair."
 wam_modjam_events.0002.b_tt:0 "Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair."

 wam_modjam_events.0003.desc:0 "An old man comes to you in secret with a.. shameful proposal, in his own words - he and his spouse have been trying for a child for the longest time, and yet they fail to consume. He pleads for your help, citing your rumored knowledge in forbidden arts as a reason."
 wam_modjam_events.0003.a:0 "I might, if you're willing to pay."
 wam_modjam_events.0003.a_tt:0 "He should respect my trade..."
 wam_modjam_events.0003.b:0 "Hmmm, this might call for more.. earthly solutions..."
 wam_modjam_events.0003.b_tt:0 "I am a man of earthly delights..."

 wam_modjam_events.0004.b:0 "My curiosity compels me..."
 wam_modjam_events.0004.b_tt:0 "A little sip won't hurt... maybe..."

 wam_modjam_events.0005.t:0 "It just works!"
 wam_modjam_events.0005.desc:0 "Your spouse seems to note your wand is acting more erratic by the day. It seems to be malfunctioning."
 wam_modjam_events.0005.a:0 "Nonsense!"
 wam_modjam_events.0005.a_tt:0 "This probably isn't a good idea..."
 wam_modjam_events.0005.b:0 "I should probably discard it..."
 wam_modjam_events.0005.b_tt:0 "It's going to hurt, replacing it..."
 
 wam_modjam_events.0006.t:0 "It just works!"
 wam_modjam_events.0006.desc:0 "I will show her, the wand is perfectly fine!!"
 wam_modjam_events.0006.a:0 "It sure seems unstable though..."

 wam_modjam_events.0007.t:0 "It just works!"
 wam_modjam_events.0007.desc:0 "The wand seems to have misfired, turning my spouse into dust after a few seconds."
 wam_modjam_events.0007.a:0 "What a tragedy, my sweet love..."
 wam_modjam_events.0007.a_tt:0 "Sadness consumes me..."
 wam_modjam_events.0007.b:0 "I didn't even like her anyway..."
 wam_modjam_events.0007.b_tt:0 "Good riddance."

 wam_modjam_events.0008.t:0 "It just works!"
 wam_modjam_events.0008.desc:0 "The wand seems to have misfired, turning my spouse's beautiful hair white."

 wam_modjam_events.0009.b:0 "I didn't even like you!"
 wam_modjam_events.0009.b_tt:0 "I'm done with this!"

 wam_modjam_events.0010.desc:0 "I guess I'm going to roll her ashes into this sheet of scroll... I heard in the Levant, some monks breathe in the air like this..."
 wam_modjam_events.0010.a:0 "Rest in peace, clown woman!"

 wam_modjam_events.0011.a:0 "I am become He Who Lives Outside of Time."
 wam_modjam_events.0011.a_tt:0 "Years become meaningless, like leaves in the wind..."
 wam_modjam_events.0011.b:0 "This is heresy of the highest order..."
 wam_modjam_events.0011.b_tt:0 "Man should not play [GetPlayer.GetFaith.CreatorName]..."

 wam_modjam_events.0012.t:0 "The Elixir of Life"
 wam_modjam_events.0012.desc:0 "Catastrophe! Your feeble attempt at brewing the fabled Elixir of Life evaporates after a few seconds. Your cauldron lies in ruins, the room filled with strange, colorful smoke."
 wam_modjam_events.0012.a:0 "I must keep trying. A lesson in humility."
 wam_modjam_events.0012.b:0 "I have failed... There is no point in continuing..."

 wam_eltyranos.0001.desc:0 "Several locals come at you at the local market you are inspecting.\n\nWe saw a witch the other day. It was dusk and we were on our way back from the tavern. She was carrying a broom and a pointy hat. We tried to catch her in order to bring her to you, but she immediately got on her broom and took off!\n\nAs you investigate, many persons seem to have seen a comet going backwards. This sounds like a bad omen."

 wam_eltyranos.0002.desc:0 "After you followed the locals to a remote hut, a woman is already attached to a pile of dry wood.\n\nI am innocent, she says. She pleads that Tim the farmer is trying for years to get her land in order to extend his own fields.\n\nTim says he saw her turn someone into a newt. He does not sound very convincing.\n\n[court_chaplain.GetName] says that given her costume, she must be a witch."
