There are rumors he is the very same as the legendary alchemist #italic Jabir ibn Hayyan#!, who died many years ago. Surely the stories about Jabir's immortality are too fantastical to be true... or could Jabir's life be even stranger than the rumors claim?\n\n#bold How will Jabir use his "Science of Balance," as he calls it, to further humanity's knowledge and wisdom?#!"

 trait_druid_desc:0 "Druids are commonly known as sorcerers with supernatural powers, particularly for their ability to perform the art of divination. Stories say they cast spells and turn people into animals or stones, or curse peoples' crops to be blighted. Often sought out as adjudicators, lorekeepers, healers, and political advisors, they are well respected in society. \n\nIn truth they are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but instead see themselves as extensions of it's indomitable will."
