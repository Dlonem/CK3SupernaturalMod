A menagerie to be sure.\n\nAs you start to head off after taking stock of her odd assortment of wares, the peddler stops you.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have something special over here. An elixir that promises eternity but.. not without cost."\n\nThe peddler leans in close and speaks low.\n\n"The true cost is different for each person my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. My fee is 25 gold, of course.""

Blood is all over your naked body."

You can hear the maids beating heart and the wooshing of blood as it flows.\n\nThe next thing you know, she is laying there lifeless with her neck gouged open and covered in blood. You look over to a small mirror in her chambers. You find your face, neck, and torso covered in blood!"

This admittedly took you by surprise, but it wasn't enough to prevent your victory.\n\nAs the court physician bandaged your wounds, your head began to pound, and you became feverish.

With you being like [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim], telling anyone about [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim] would put you at risk as well. Reluctantly, you agree to the price. Though, you don't understand how much exactly you've just paid.\n\nAfter the conversation concluded, [spn_new_created_vampire.GetTitledFirstName] took hold of you and sunk their teeth into your neck.

For a small price of course..”. [spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe|U] speaks of creatures with indomitable power that broke free from the shackles of time. I stand there, in disbelief, unable to believe [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] tales. [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] mysterious aura gives weight to [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] words but can I really trust what they are saying to be true?"

[spn_new_created_vampire.GetSheHe|U], with inexplicable speed, runs to the throne where I sit, and bites my neck! I feel a sense of warmth as the blood drips down my neck."

I am to choose between drinking [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHis] blood or allowing [spn_new_created_vampire.GetHerHim] to bite me. With the little amount of sense left in me I choose the former.\n\nOne moment I am placing the empty goblet of blood down and the next I am standing on the bloody remains of my chambermaid.

By some miracle, your fellow hunters find you and fire arrows at the beast, it manages to kill some of them and you get injured in the melee and lose consciousness.\n\nYou awake in your bed in bandages. You feel no pain and seem to have fully healed. Your chancellor enters and explains you were attacked by a large wolf and that your retinue saved you. No one had noticed it walked the way humans do and due to a strong fog, you decided to ruminate on the matter once you feel better.\n\nThe night brings no relief. Due to a level of pain you thought wasn’t possible to experience, you can’t seem to sleep. Your entire body feels as if it is being torn apart from the inside. You scream and start destroying everything in your chambers. Your mind blacks out. In the next moment, you are standing on a hill near your castle howling into the night.

 spn_embrace.2012.desc.a:0 "After what feels like hours, but must have been mere minutes in truth, only one guard and I remain on our feet. Bloodied and deeply wounded, our chances seem quite slim. I remember this particular guard, [spn_new_created_lycan.GetSheHe] never spoke much. Wasn’t aware [spn_new_created_lycan.GetSheHe] was such a capable fighter. I should have paid more attention. I should have done many things differently now that I think of it.\n\nI am brought back to reality by my companion’s frightening warcry. The ambushers hesitate and we take this moment to charge."

I can rest in peace knowing I gave my life to a worthy liege such as you.” [spn_new_created_lycan.GetSheHe] grabs my leg and bites into it. I can no longer withstand the pain and faint.\n\nThe pain wakes me and the full moon seems awfully close. My bones break and shift and I am overcome by a strong hunger.

 spn_embrace.3001.desc:0 "A scream awakens you in the night. You take a moment to light a candle and grab a knife. You open the door to your chambers and look down the hallway. Through the dim candlelight, you make out your guardsman lying on the ground. There is blood and gore strewn throughout the hallway.\n\nYou hear the sound of your guards frantically shouting throughout the keep. At the next moment, you hear a growl that sends shivers down your spine. Suddenly the glow of two large eyes reflects the light of your candle. The wolf-like monstrosity moves into the candlelight and unleashes a rumbling howl."

 spn_embrace.3002.desc:0 "The raging beast bursts through the door and tears through your chambers. It stops and begins to rummage around like a dog on the hunt. The beast stops at the foot of your bed briefly and then lunges under it. It's fangs and claws reaching for you.\n\nYour shrill screams bring half a dozen guardsmen to your room. With fierce battle cries, they attack. Shrieking in pain, the creature retreats from under the bed and crashes through a window in your chambers. Your guards help you out from under the bed, shaking their heads in disbelief."

 spn_embrace.3003.desc:0 "As you race through the corridors, you can hear the creature behind you. As you speed along, you find others that met the beast before you. What remains of them is spread all over. You see a door that leads to the courtyard and get through it as quickly as you can, slamming the door behind you. Not waiting to see if it holds, you bolt out into the courtyard. A crash behind you tells you that the door didn't hold.\n\nAs the beast is nearly upon you, a hooded warrior rushes to confront the beast. With the warrior and creature in battle, you take a moment to gather your wits and catch your breath. You see a spear lying on the ground, pick it up, and throw it at the creature. The distraction was enough for the stranger to behead the beast in one swift motion.\n\n"What was that?" You ask the stranger.\nAs they pull their hood back, "A Lycan... these beasts, and other foul creatures of this world, are growing in number. I'm [spn_new_created_hunter.GetTitledFirstName]." \n\n"What can be done?" You ask.\n"I can teach you to fight the beasts, but the path won't be easy.
