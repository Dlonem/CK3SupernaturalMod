#Hunter Event Localization 
 spn_hunters.0001.t:0 "Hunter: Witch Spotted"
 spn_hunters.0001.desc:0 "Several locals come at you at the local market you are inspecting.\n\nWe saw a witch the other day. It was dusk and we were on our way back from the tavern. She was carrying a bunch of ingredients, no doubt to curse the townspeople. We tried to catch her in order to bring her to you, but she must have used her magic and confused us and got away!\n\nAs you investigate, many persons seem to have seen a comet going backwards. This sounds like a bad omen."
 spn_hunters.0001.a:0 "Looks to be the beginning of a Witch hunt!"
 spn_hunters.0001.b:0 "It sounds too dangerous. You should find someone more qualified."
 spn_hunters.0001.c:0 "Sounds like the kind of nonsense you hear from a drunken lot."
 spn_hunters.0001.d:0 "I'll find your witch, but I expect to be paid."
 spn_hunters.0001.e:0 "You came to the right person. Let the professional take over."
 spn_hunters.0001.c.tt:0 "You dismiss the group of locals, it's natural for others to make up things in their head when they have nothing better to do."
 spn_hunters.0001.d.tt:0 "You receive half now due to your reputation as a Hunter, and you'll get the rest when you get the witch."
 

 spn_hunters.0002.desc:0 "After days of tracking through the dense woods, your group comes upon what looks like a narrow, man-made path snaking into the shadows.\n\nSomeone mutters that the air feels strange, as if crackling with unseen energy. Another quickly dismisses it, saying it’s probably Andrew needing to bathe again.\n\nThe discussion devolves into light bickering, and before you can get everyone back on track, people start wandering off in different directions, stumbling over roots and dead leaves—possibly covering the correct trail without even realizing it."
 spn_hunters.0002.a:0 "Attempt to follow her tracks."
 spn_hunters.0002.aa.t:0 "Your party finds the witch"
 spn_hunters.0002.ab.t:0 "Your party loses the witch's trail"
 spn_hunters.0002.ac.t:0 "The witch finds your party first"
 spn_hunters.0002.b:0 "Attempt to follow the magic."
 spn_hunters.0002.b.tt:0 "There is in fact some trace amounts of magic in the air."
 spn_hunters.0002.c:0 "Maybe this wasn't a good idea.."
 spn_hunters.0002.c.tt:0 "You quit the search for the witch and turn back."
 
 spn_hunters.00021.t:0 "Hunter: Witch Lost"
 spn_hunters.00021.a:0 "Hopefully someone else gets her.."
 spn_hunters.00021.desc:0 "After days of fruitless searching, the group admits defeat. Bags are packed, and the weary party begins the trek back to town. At least Andrew is being told—quite bluntly—that a bath is long overdue.\n\nStill, as you leave the woods behind, a nagging thought lingers. Was there really magic in the air back there, or just imagination running wild? One can only hope someone else has better luck picking up the trail where you left off."

 
 spn_hunters.0003.desc:0 "What appears to be a shack deep in the woods stands before you, and outside, a woman is already tied to a pile of dry wood.\n\nShe looks eerily familiar, her features stirring tales of 'Baba Yaga.' But something within you whispers that she is not the infamous witch... or is she? 'I am innocent,' she pleads. She claims that Joseph the woodsman has long sought to drive her away from these woods to expand his felling grounds.\n\nJoseph insists he saw her curse his brother, leaving him bedridden with an unseen affliction. His voice wavers, as if even he is unsure. Yet the murmurs of your companions grow—it’s said that only a witch could bring such misfortune upon a man."
 
 spn_hunters.0003.a:0 "Burn the witch! We can't take any chances."
 spn_hunters.0003.a.tt:0 "[witch.GetName] will be executed for her crimes."
 spn_hunters.0003.b:0 "Are you all mad? Look at her... those 'ingredients' were for stew!"  
 spn_hunters.0003.b.tt:0 "[witch.GetName] will be free to go."  
 spn_hunters.0003.c:0 "Untie her! I know how to make her talk..."  
 spn_hunters.0003.c.tt:0 "You convince them to leave [witch.GetName] alone if she shares the secrets of witchcraft."  
 

 
 spn_hunters.0010.t:0 "Hunter: Monster Sighting"
 spn_hunters.0010.desc:0 "The tavern buzzes with the usual noise—clinking tankards, bursts of laughter, and the low hum of conversation. As you sip your drink, a nearby patron’s voice rises just enough to catch your attention.\n\n'I swear it,' they murmur, their tone conspiratorial. 'The way he looked—his skin was... off, like he'd never seen the sun. And then there was this sound… like snarling, or maybe just the clearing of a throat. I don’t know. But it gave me chills.'\n\nThe patron leans closer to their companions, lowering their voice as they continue. 'He’s staying upstairs, last room down the hall.'\n\nYour curiosity stirs. Perhaps it’s nothing more than idle gossip fueled by ale… but what if it’s not?"
 spn_hunters.0010.a:0 "You grab your drink and try to join their table."  
 spn_hunters.0010.a.tt:0 "Best to hear more before jumping to conclusions."
 spn_hunters.0010.b:0 "You settle the patron's tab before attempting to join their table."  
 spn_hunters.0010.b.tt:0 "Paying for their drinks makes it easier to join the conversation without raising suspicion."  
 spn_hunters.0010.c:0 "You walk over with the looks of a seasoned hunter."  
 spn_hunters.0010.c.tt:0 "The patron seems to piece together your appearance and reputation and offers no objection as you take a seat."
 spn_hunters.0010.d:0 "You toss some coin on the counter and head for the door."  
 spn_hunters.0010.d.tt:0 "Perhaps it's best not to meddle in rumors."  

 spn_hunters.0011.desc:0 "You take a seat at the patron's table, drink in hand, attempting to blend into the tavern’s lively noise. The patron barely acknowledges you, lost in a string of ramblings about their travels, strange dreams, and cursed livestock.\n\nJust as you begin to think the conversation is a waste of time, the patron circles back to the topic that caught your ear earlier—monsters. They lower their voice and describe the figure they claim to have seen.\n\nIt’s hard to make sense of the words through the haze of ale, and the more the patron talks, the less certain you feel. Are they onto something, or is this just the product of too many drinks?"
 spn_hunters.0011.a:0 "It sounds suspiciously like a Vampire."  
 spn_hunters.0011.a.tt:0 "The light skin, the strange presence... it all lines up."
 spn_hunters.0011.b:0 "This might be a Werewolf in hiding."  
 spn_hunters.0011.b.tt:0 "The strange behavior and guttural sounds hint at something feral."  
 spn_hunters.0011.c:0 "This is a waste of time."  
 spn_hunters.0011.c.tt:0 "You finish your drink and leave the patron to their rambling."

 spn_hunters.0012.desc:0 "You make your way over, and the patron gives you a nod of acknowledgment, a small grin forming as they welcome your company. Whatever it is, they seem more than happy to share their story.\n\n'You wouldn’t believe it,' they say, leaning closer as if sharing a dark secret. 'The fellow upstairs—he wasn’t right. He had this... unsettling presence about him. I swear I saw his eyes light up like embers when the barkeep said they had no more rooms available!' They chuckle nervously, but you sense they’re not joking. \n\nWhatever the truth may be, the story certainly has your attention."
 spn_hunters.0012.a:0 "This sounds like a Vampire to me."  
 spn_hunters.0012.a.tt:0 "A creature of the night... it could be exactly what you’re after."  
 spn_hunters.0012.b:0 "This might be a Werewolf."  
 spn_hunters.0012.b.tt:0 "The talk of the eyes and strange behavior lines up perfectly."
 spn_hunters.0012.c:0 "I know what they’re describing—it’s a Werewolf."  
 spn_hunters.0012.c.tt:0 "Your experience as a hunter leaves no doubt in your mind."
 spn_hunters.0012.d:0 "I think I’ve heard enough. I’ll be taking that coin purse, though."  
 spn_hunters.0012.d.tt:0 "While everyone’s distracted, you quietly swipe the coin purse and leave." 
 
 spn_hunters.0013.desc:0 "You ascend the stairs to the upper floor, your nerves on edge. The noise of the lively tavern below makes it hard to hear much, but you tell yourself that’s probably for the best.\n\nThe wooden stake in your hand feels heavier than you imagined, but you steady your grip and push forward. As the door creaks open, you scan the figure before you. Something is off. You expected sharp fangs, something distinctly vampiric—but there’s none of that. Their teeth, however, are slightly too jagged to ignore.\n\nYou replay the conversation in your mind—was it a guttural growl they mentioned earlier... or just a throat clearing? Your thoughts swirl as the realization creeps in: this isn’t a vampire after all."
 spn_hunters.0013.a:0 "You’re too far in to back down now. Engage the monster!"
 spn_hunters.0013.a.tt:0 "Commit to the attack, for better or worse. There’s no turning back now."
 spn_hunters.0013.b:0 "This might be your chance to become more—one of them."
 spn_hunters.0013.b.tt:0 "Due to the way you started the encounter, your chance of sucess is lowered."
 spn_hunters.0013.c:0 "Quickly close the door and run away, ignoring the laughter behind you."
 spn_hunters.0013.c.tt:0 "Flee from the situation, saving your skin but leaving your coinpurse."
 
 spn_hunters.0013.aa.t:0 "You manage to take down the monster!"
 spn_hunters.0013.ab.t:0 "The monster manages to get away!"
 spn_hunters.0013.ac.t:0 "The monster infects you and gets away!"
 spn_hunters.0013.ad.t:0 "The monster kills you."
 spn_hunters.0013.e.tt:0 "They laugh and let you leave unharmed."
 
 
 spn_hunters.0014.desc:0 "You ascend the stairs, sword drawn, each step measured as the sounds of the rowdy tavern below grow distant. Pushing the door open, you find the creature waiting inside—a figure whose muscles ripple with unnatural strength. Their sharp eyes widen in surprise, and for a moment, they seem caught off guard by your presence.\n\nYou know hesitation will cost you; the best chance to survive is to strike fast. But the sheer power radiating from them gives you pause—perhaps there’s another way. Time slows as you weigh your options, feeling the tension in the air shift. Whatever you choose, the creature won’t stay stunned for long."
 spn_hunters.0014.a:0 "Attack while the creature is shocked!"
 spn_hunters.0014.a.tt:0 "You strike swiftly, aiming to overcome the beast before it can gain it's footing."
 spn_hunters.0014.b:0 "Lower your weapon and ask the creature to turn you into one of them."
 spn_hunters.0014.b.tt:0 "You lower your weapon, hoping the creature might grant you its strength and power."
 spn_hunters.0014.c:0 "Apologize for entering the wrong room and leave."
 spn_hunters.0014.c.tt:0 "Retreat from the situation, saving your skin but leaving your dignity behind."

 spn_hunters.0014.aa.t:0 "You manage to take down the monster!"
 spn_hunters.0014.ab.t:0 "The monster manages to get away!"
 spn_hunters.0014.ac.t:0 "The monster infects you and gets away!"
 spn_hunters.0014.ad.t:0 "The monster kills you."
 spn_hunters.0014.e.tt:0 "They laugh and let you leave unharmed."
