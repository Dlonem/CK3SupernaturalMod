You recognize the figure, though their face remains obscured beneath a dark hood. The one you sought out, the vampire whose blood once coursed through your veins, now stands before you.\n \n "Forgive me," the figure says, their voice smooth yet tinged with an odd detachment. "Time slips away from us so easily. I've been... preoccupied. But I'm here now, and we must act quickly. The risk of the blood leaving your system is... minimal." \n \nBefore you can utter a word, their hand is on your throat, cold and unyielding. Panic surges through you as the realization dawns—whatever hope you had is fading fast, slipping away as surely as the vampire's grip tightens."

The transformation is complete; you are now one of them."
