 spn_gain_power.4010.t:0 "Bite Night"
 spn_gain_power.4010.desc:0 "As I sneak around the castle, I find one of my courtiers alone by an open window, taking in the crisp night air. I wait behind an archway and observe where the guards are presently located and if my courtier plans on leaving. \n\nI have decided that I will try and do this quickly and quietly. My plan is to grab them and look directly into their eyes and compel them to remain quiet and erase their memory of this night."
 spn_gain_power.4010.a:0 "Snatch, Eat, Erase. Got it."
 spn_gain_power.4010.a.tt:0 "I will finally quench my bloodthirst."

 spn_gain_power.4010.b:0 "On second thought.. I'll go drain an animal."
 spn_gain_power.4010.b.tt:0 "Hunt an animal in the woods, no power gain possible."
 
 
 ### Vampire Bite Night: Success ###
 spn_gain_power.4011.t:0 "Bite Night: Success"
 spn_gain_power.4011.desc:0 "My courtier never saw me coming, I was able to look into their eyes, and tell them, "You will remain silent, and that you had a nasty run in with a dog to explain the marks on your neck". \n\n My hunger subsides, and I return back to my quarters - no one saw me this night."
 spn_gain_power.4011.a:0 "My strength feels renewed."
 spn_gain_power.4011.a.tt:0 "There's something different about this drain. I feel like my strength is growing... or I am just full."
 
 ### Vampire Bite Night: Discovered ###
 spn_gain_power.4012.t:0 "Bite Night: Discovered"
 spn_gain_power.4012.desc:0 "Before I could even begin speaking, my courtier let out a harrowing scream! \n\n I sink my teeth into their neck and begin to drain. But it does not matter, the courtier has already recognized me and my guards have seen my fangs. As their liege, I command them to stand down and they listen hesitantly. \n\n Everyone knows my secret now, but I am still in charge."
 spn_gain_power.4012.a:0 "Not as quick as I thought I was.."
 spn_gain_power.4012.a.tt:0 "Even though my subjects know of my nature, I am still their liege."
 
 ### Vampire Bite Night: Killed ###
 spn_gain_power.4013.t:0 "Bite Night: Killed"
 spn_gain_power.4013.desc:0 "Everything was going according to plan, I snuck up on my courtier and compelled them to remain silent and not move. Except.. my hunger has gotten the best of me, and as I am consuming blood, I lose track of time and didn't realize how long ago their body went limp."
 spn_gain_power.4013.a:0 "It seems my thirst got the best of me.."
 spn_gain_power.4013.a.tt:0 "I let my bloodthirst get the best of me and killed my poor courier."


 ### Werewolf Feeding Event ###
 spn_gain_power.4020.t:0 "Heart Healthy"
 spn_gain_power.4020.desc:0 "I feel a sense of strength and an animalistic desire washing over me, this night offers a great opportunity to go out into the woods and find an animal to feed upon, as the peasants and castlefolk are less likely to be out. \n\nIt has been awhile since I last fed on an animal's heart, as I tend to avoid feeding on any humans to avoid suspicion and being hunted, not that the locals are smart enough to discern anything but an animal attack.."
 spn_gain_power.4020.a:0 "The night is upon us, I will head into the woods."
 spn_gain_power.4020.a.tt:0 "I will finally be able to indulge my hunger."

 ### Werewolf Heart Healthy: Success ###
 spn_gain_power.4021.t:0 "Heart Healthy: Successful Hunt"
 spn_gain_power.4021.desc:0 "Power thrums through my veins in the solitude of the woods, where I can find no one but myself and my fellow animals. \n\n So far I have found only small prey, such as rabbits and foxes, but I smell something larger on the wind moments before I hear a twig snap behind me. \n\n I whirl to see a beautiful and majestic elk, its flesh corded with muscle. Within moments I am on the attack, lunging towards it, our bodies colliding and its skin tearing beneath my claws. I fall upon it like a force of nature, savaging my way through to reach its heart. \n\n With the taste of that heart lingering on my tongue, and blood soaking almost every inch of me, I walk naked back to my castle."
 spn_gain_power.4021.a:0 "Tonight, my strength has grown."
 spn_gain_power.4021.a.tt:0 "I begin my journey back to the castle, and clean myself up."
 
 ### Werewolf Heart Healthy: Discovered ###
 spn_gain_power.4022.t:0 "Heart Healthy: Discovered"
 spn_gain_power.4022.desc:0 "Tonight's hunt has been going as well as you can ask for, I was able to bring down a large Deer and also chased down a couple foxes and consumed their hearts.\n\nAs I decided to call it a night and travel back to the castle, as I shifted back into my human form to clean myself off, I should have checked my surroundings first. There stands on the ridge on horseback, one of my messengers returning from the count I sent him off to, staring at me with disbelief - and then he sped off on his horse into the town yelling. "Our Liege is a Werewolf!"\n\n I guess the dog is out of the bag now."
 spn_gain_power.4022.a:0 "How did I not sense them nearby?"
 spn_gain_power.4022.a.tt:0 "They will make it into town by the time I catch them, if I chased them down I would be seen as more than the monster I am."
 
 
 ### Werewolf Heart Healthy: Killed Vassal ###
 spn_gain_power.4023.t:0 "Heart Healthy: Killed Vassal"
 spn_gain_power.4023.desc:0 "As I finished stashing my clothes and armor, I heard some noise far off in the woods and decided to shift into my wolf form, and head off into the opposite direction. All I need is to satiate my hunger and head back, no sense getting into trouble out here.\n\nI was able to find a beautiful Elk some distance out in the woods, and thought I was about to get even luckier as I lunged at another meal behind a rock, and as my teeth teared into it's neck, I realized too late..\n\nI just ripped out the throat of one of my vassals, whom I now recall was supposed to go on a hunting party in the next week! "
 spn_gain_power.4023.a:0 "It seems they decided to start their hunt earlier than planned."
 spn_gain_power.4023.a.tt:0 "It appears it was not just any hunter, but one of my vassals who was out hunting on a Full Moon."
 
 
 ### Werewolf Heart Healthy: Death by Hunter###
 spn_gain_power.4024.t:0 "Heart Healthy: Death by Hunter"
 spn_gain_power.4024.desc:0 "My hunt has been going well, I was able to feed on a group of Deer that I managed to sneak up on and that satisfied me greatly. \nI plan on getting just one more kill before I call it a night and head back to the Castle, but those twigs snapping earlier has left me a little paranoid.\n\nI was able to locate a final rabbit, when I heard another twig snap closeby - and I identifed a face in that direction at the same time an arrow sprouted from my chest.\n\nI had only ever seen them in my court when they brought up an issue with beasts and creatures of the night, they seemed to have taken matters into their own hands.."
 spn_gain_power.4024.a:0 "Bested by a Hunter..."
 spn_gain_power.4024.a.tt:0 "I look down to see an arrow sprout out of my chest."
