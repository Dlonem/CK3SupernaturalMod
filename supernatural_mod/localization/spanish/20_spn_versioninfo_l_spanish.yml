Joining our Discord allows us to update you on the status of the mod. Additionally, you can sign up for Beta testing newer updates before they make their way onto Steam/Plaza. Come share your immortal stories with us! Find the link on the mod page.\n\n#high 2.17 Updates: #!\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Made it so the Invite to Join House and Adopt options would show up in the menu only when it was possible for you to actually change the reasons why you cannot use them on a character. \n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Adoption now removes the bastard and legitimized bastard traits from an adoptee. It also moves the character into your court. \n\n#high 2.16 Updates: #!\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Added a decision that allows you to search for an orphaned child. \n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Adopted children will now be properly re-espnuated for the line of succession upon adoption. \n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Localization keys that were nuked from base game have been changed to ones that do exist. \n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Log file will no longer get filled up with errors related to invalid scoping of culture for confer interactions. \n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Vampire fangs will no longer be a dark grey color or cause other graphical oddities (Thank you Sparc of POD). \n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$ Added some additional information on the immortal traits to, hopefully, make it more clear to new players how they work. \n\n#high Thanks again! #!\nThe V&L Coven"
